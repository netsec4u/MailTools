# MailTools

## Description

This module contains functions send email using the SMTP protocol.  It includes functions to transform data tables, error objects, and other PowerShell object to an html table.  Email templates can be created from XSL templates.

## Support

This module has extensively been used within PowerShell on Windows.  Limited testing has been performed within a PowerShell running on non-Windows operating systems.  Most functions should work as expected; however, I expect some issues to exist for functions that interact with the file system.
